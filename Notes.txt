README should explain what is inside the code and how to modify the file containing the parameters and the method choice.

Some suggestions:
    - group the header and source files in an include and a source foalder;
    - use a struct to contain all the optimization parameters;
    - rely on methods of the std library for the implementation of vector operations and replace all the for loops;
    - try implementation with function templates to choose the strategy for the computation of the learning rate;
    - add a check on the validity of the parameter indicating the chosen strategy.


The code is readable and correct, the comments are clear.
